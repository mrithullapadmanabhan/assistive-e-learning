mouseadaptor class: to receive mouse events
timertask: to schedule tasks

global1:
    initialise variables
toolkit:
    to get screen dimensions

------------------------------------------
timer3: for that buttons - if commented: no way to exit program, even button clicks wouldnt work
timer2: for redline (vertical scanning stroke): it wouldnt be dispalyed thereby its funtion of selecting cant be achieved
timer1: for blueline (horizontal scanning stroke): all funtions wrto horizontal scanning isnt working
timer: for the frames: entire system doesnt work

seqence:
timer->timer1->timer2->timer3

------------------------------------------
attributes inside global1 class:
    int isscan=0; //boolean
	int cnt=0;
	int stopmain=0; //boolean
	int scanquad=0;
	int x1=0,y1=0,x2=0,y2=0,ny2=0;

mouse class:
    global object (global1), image(background), graphis(g1)


timer: quadrant scanning 
	takes 2 input, mouse and global1 object.
	this timer object is passed to myTimer (java.util.Timer), which takes 3 inputs (timer, delay and period)


paintComponent(): automatically called whenever the screen becomes visible

isscan -  variable which indicates that quadrant scanning is in progress and selection is yet to be done
obg.cnt - variable to check the number of quadrants moved. after 2 full quadrant traversals, the quadrant scanner stops. 
	      this is checked using obg.cnt==9

ibt - button counter ranges from 1 to n buttons

Robot  - This class is used to generate native system input events for the purposes of 
		 automatic mouse clicking

custom.java 
  Has variables used to make the customization of the scanning of the buttons (to change color, font, etc)
  Has toggleFrame function used for calling the keyborad

observation - keyboard scanning is happening only once we press from the the symbol ` onwards. 
			  (before that scanning does not take place)

			  There is custom option in keyboard where we can modify the font size, color, layout, and speed of the scan.

			  If we click shift, numbers will change to special characters in the keyboard.
			  There are 2 layouts in keyboard - ABC and QWERTY
