mouseadaptor class: to receive mouse events
timertask: to schedule tasks

global1:
    initialise variables
toolkit:
    to get screen dimensions

------------------------------------------
timer3: for that buttons - if commented: no way to exit program, even button clicks wouldnt work
timer2: for redline (vertical scanning stroke): it wouldnt be dispalyed thereby its funtion of selecting cant be achieved
timer1: for blueline (horizontal scanning stroke): all funtions wrto horizontal scanning isnt working
timer: for the frames: entire system doesnt work

seqence:
timer->timer1->timer2->timer3

------------------------------------------
attributes inside global1 class:
    int isscan=0; //boolean
	int cnt=0;
	int stopmain=0; //boolean
	int scanquad=0;
	int x1=0,y1=0,x2=0,y2=0,ny2=0;

mouse class:
    global object (global1), image(background), graphis(g1)


timer: quadrant scanning 
	takes 2 input, mouse and global1 object.
	this timer object is passed to myTimer (java.util.Timer), which takes 3 inputs (timer, delay and period)


paintComponent(): automatically called whenever the screen becomes visible

isscan -  variable which indicates that quadrant scanning is in progress and selection is yet to be done
obg.cnt - variable to check the number of quadrants moved. after 2 full quadrant traversals, the quadrant scanner stops. 
	      this is checked using obg.cnt==9

ibt - button counter ranges from 1 to n buttons
